# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description 
This project is meant to showcase my skills using an SQL database to make a employee tracker. In this project I am tasked to use inquirer, mysql2 and console.table.

## Installation
To use this you must have Mysql installed and you have to npm i inquirer, mysql2, and console.table.
* Must have Mysql
* Must npm i inquirer, mysql2, and console.table
* If inquirer is giving you trouble then npm install --save inquirer@^8.0.0

## Usage 
When you have the code ready and have the packages installed you just do "node index.js" and the code should start in the terminal. Then you can check employees and add roles or departments.
